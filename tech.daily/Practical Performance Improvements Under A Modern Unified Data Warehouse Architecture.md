# Practical Performance Improvements With A Modern Unified Data Warehouse Architecture
ABC Tech Group

# Abstract
ABC is a data provider of the global mobile market performance and deserves the leadership of the industry with the most complete and diverse datasets, the richest dimensional modeling, and the out-of-box web analytic platform.  丰富的数据维度，丰富的数据集，以及开箱即用的Web分析平台.

ABC has decided to build a modern unified data warehouse under a modern could data platform architecture to accelerate our business and deliver the most exciting features to the clients. 

We chose the [Snowflake Cloud Data Platform](https://www.snowflake.com/) as our unified data warehouse(abbr UDW later) and migrated all our data into it in the past 12 months. We have sunset our legacy databases in our systems such as PL/Proxy, Citus, HBbase, and Elasticsearch and achieved more than 10x performance improvements after the process.

By leveraging the new architecture, we now have a unified data pipeline platform, more than 500 dedicated easy-to-manage ETL jobs, and the most important assets of ABC - ***the unified data warehouse*** - the single source of the truth for all high-level applications, delivery channels, internal analytics, and data scientist.

During the migration, we suffered a lot as every complex software project would and got much more understanding in Computer Science & Engineering topics such as Cloud Computing, Big Data, Multiple Dimension Data Modeling, Microservice, and Evolutionary Architecture.

In this paper, we going to talk about what ABC has done, the experience, best practices, and how we solve the critical engineering issues among data modeling, performance, and architecture to get the unified data warehouse platform. There is no silver bullet in the software world for sure. But we can indeed live an easier life with the right choice of cloud service and architecture.
